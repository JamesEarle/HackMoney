# Royalty tokens

[EIP-2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) - This proposal is to enforce payment of a royalty every time an ERC-721 is tranferred to a new owner.

[EIP-3589](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3589) - This proposal is to enable "assembly" of ERC-721, ERC-20 and/or ERC-1155 into a single ERC-721 token.
